Patients developing fatal or nonfatal exacerbations of lung disease, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction during either epidemic were considered cases. For each case, four age-and sex-matched controls were randomly sampled, and patient records were reviewed. Conditional logistic regression and propensity scores were used to assess vaccine effectiveness after adjustment for confounding factors. In seasons one and two, respectively, 87% (47/54) and 85% (171/202) of the cases and 74% (155/210) and 75% (575/766) of the controls had been vaccinated. After adjustments, vaccination was not associated with reductions in complications (season one: odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26, 3.48; season two: odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.96; pooled odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.80).
